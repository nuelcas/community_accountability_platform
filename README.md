# Community Accountability Platform (CAP)

Welcome to the official repository of the **Community Accountability Platform (CAP)**. CAP is a civic engagement platform designed to empower youth and communities through anonymity, accountability, and transparency in governance. By providing tools for reporting governance failures, creating community polls, and sharing educational resources, CAP seeks to foster positive change and collaboration within communities.

## Current Status

The **CAP** website is still in the development stage, and we are actively working to build its core features, including the anonymous reporting system, community polls, real-time issue tracking, and civic education hub.

## Key Features

- **Anonymous Reporting System**: Report issues like corruption, public service failures, and governance problems anonymously. Geo-tagged reports allow for accurate location tracking.
- **Community Polls and Feedback**: Users can voice their opinions on socio-political issues through polls, and data insights will be shared with policymakers.
- **Real-Time Issue Tracking**: Track the progress of reported issues on a map interface to ensure accountability.
- **Civic Education Resources**: Provides materials on citizens' rights, how to engage with leadership, and step-by-step guides to taking civic action.
- **Leaderboard of Change-Makers**: Recognizes and rewards top contributors for their efforts in reporting issues and contributing to solutions.
- **Youth-Led Initiative Showcase**: Features successful youth-driven initiatives and provides a platform for others to propose and share ideas.
